CmisCmdlets
===========
Cmdlets to use CMIS from Powershell and Pash

# Compilation

The solution contains multiple configurations: For using Pash and for using Powershell.
Both targets have are split in Release and Debug.

If you want to compile against Pash, make sure you add a compiled Pash version
to the project. To do this, clone Pash (https://github.com/Pash-Project/Pash)
and invoke `update_pash.sh /path/to/cloned/Pash`

Then build the project as usual.
